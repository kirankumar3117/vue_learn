                My name's kiran kumar. I've recently completed a skill development course from Masai School with strong background in Full-Stack Web Development, Data Structures And Algorithms.
                
                During the course i have done countless of projects individualy.And done three collaborative projects. I spent most of my leisure hours in writing codes and blogs. Right now I'm also trying a hand at mastering the skills that i have learned, and I love to learn and explore new arenas.
